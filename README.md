# Twitter_users_analysis
Twitter users on map

This is my modification of the idea taken from the nice series of 3 articles by Daniela VÃ¡zquez (https://d4tagirl.com/2017/05/how-to-fetch-twitter-users-with-r)
It made a lot of fun to me to play aroung with Twitter API, Google maps API and dynamic geo visualisation.
I have changed some properties in the project, such as:
- visualisation by hash tag #T-labs 
- time intervals are in months instead of days since my dataset spans almost 8 years and iterates by months are more appropriate

You are welcome to find the resulted dynamic and static visualisation in pictures folder
